					<h3> About me, at length! </h3>
					<p> <strong>I'm Lasse Laukkanen and I'm into all things related to web, electronics, and programming.</strong></p>
					<p>
                  	I'm in my second year of studies towards bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and information technology at the Tampere University of Technology. My major is in electronics and minor in software technology and computer engineering. Through my hobbies and education, I've gained experience in programming, electronics and web development.

                    Before studying in TUT, I studied Digital Media at Kymenlaakso University of Applied Sciences. These studies were more graphic design oriented. Studies included graphic design (3D/2D) and web- and game development. My personal interests are more focused towards the technical implementations but I also know the importance of good design and artwork. Having studied in two different kinds of environments, I've gained experience working with different types of people, artists, and technology-oriented people.

                    My personal problem is, that I'm a curious person and interested in so many things. I prefer trying to understand how things work, but this usually leads to another area of study and there is only so much time for one human's lifespan. On the other hand, I am no stranger to keeping on studying and learning new things.

                    Conveniently, my free time and hobbies revolve around the topics I've mentioned earlier. That could be learning game development, 3D modeling, practicing web development or attempting to compose electronic music. I've done some personal small-scale Arduino projects and got some experience on working with ATmega328P microcontroller.
